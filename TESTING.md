# Manual Testing

### EPIC | Navigation
- As a User I can navigate around the site so that I can easily view desired content.

    - The navigation bar is fixed at the top of the screen, meaning it is always seen by the user, allowing the user to navigate through the content easily & intuitively. Each nav link is named with an obvious link to the page content, for the shop and admin links there are dropdowns for subsections of the website so that there isn't too much information in the navbar.
    - I have tested that the navbar is fully responsive on all screen sizes and remains at the top of each page.

    - I have added a back to top button that appears when the user scrolls down any of the pages, enabling them to quickly navigate back to the top without having to scroll.
    - I have tested that the scroll button works and is responsive.
