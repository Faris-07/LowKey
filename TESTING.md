# Manual Testing

[Back to main README](README.md)

### EPIC | Navigation
- As a User I can navigate around the site so that I can easily view desired content.

    - The navigation bar is fixed at the top of the screen, meaning it is always seen by the user, allowing the user to navigate through the content easily & intuitively. Each nav link is named with an obvious link to the page content, for the shop and admin links there are dropdowns for subsections of the website so that there isn't too much information in the navbar.
    - I have tested that the navbar is fully responsive on all screen sizes and remains at the top of each page.

    - Also located in the footer are quick links, which has links to all pages of the website.

    - I have added a back to top button that appears when the user scrolls down any of the pages, enabling them to quickly navigate back to the top without having to scroll.
    - I have tested that the scroll button works and is responsive.

- As a User, I can view a list of products so that I can choose what products to purchase.
    - From the navbar, users can click the 'Shop' link and in the dropdown menu choose 'All Products' to be taken to the product's page, which will list every product on the store.

- As a User, I can click on a product to see its details so that I can view the description, price etc.
    - By clicking the product's image, the user is taken directly to the product's detail page, where the name, description, size, composition, quantity and price are displayed.

- As a user, I can easily identify different product categories so that I can quickly view the type of products I'm looking for.
    - From the navbar, users can click the 'Shop' link and in the dropdown and choose any category they want to view which will show a product's page, that will list every product on the store under that category.
    - From the home page, users can also find the 'Essentials' section where four featured categories are listed. Clicking either of these images takes the user to the products page, showing only items in that category.

- As a User I can search for products so that I can find specific products.
    - Located in the center of the navbar is a search bar. On smaller screens, the search bar is in the hamburger menu. Any searched word will match itself to any text in the product's title, or description and display the results on the product's page.

- As a User, I can sort the products so that I can easily find products based on price, category, or title.
    - A sort selector box is located on the products page where users can sort all products by price.

- As a User I can add items to my Wishlist so that I can save them for later.
    - Liked products will appear in the user's wishlist items list, located on the user's profile page.
